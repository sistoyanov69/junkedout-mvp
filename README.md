# JunkedOut

JunkedOut is an open-source transparency platform that analyzes real-world hiring experiences to expose systemic barriers and improve labor market fairness.

It focuses on evidence-based insight, privacy-preserving data collection, and constructive feedback mechanisms that support better recruitment practices for individuals, organizations, and institutions.

## Why JunkedOut exists

Across industries and countries, many qualified and experienced professionals are excluded from the labor market through opaque, automated, and fragmented recruitment processes.

At the same time, employers report persistent talent shortages, rising recruitment costs, and repeated operational mistakes caused by lost institutional knowledge.

JunkedOut addresses this disconnect by collecting, validating, and analyzing real-world recruitment data to make systemic patterns visible and actionable.
