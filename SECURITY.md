## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in JunkedOut, please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead, report it privately:

- **Preferred:** GitHub private security advisory (Security tab → “Report a vulnerability”)
- **Security contact:** security@junkedout.org


Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if possible)
- Impact assessment (what an attacker could do)
- Any suggested fix (optional)

We will acknowledge receipt and work toward a fix as quickly as possible.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are provided for the currently maintained version on the `main` branch.
