# JunkedOut

JunkedOut is an open-source transparency platform that analyzes real-world hiring experiences to expose systemic barriers and improve labor market fairness.

It focuses on evidence-based insight, privacy-preserving data collection, and constructive feedback mechanisms that support better recruitment practices for individuals, organizations, and institutions.

## Why JunkedOut exists

Across industries and countries, many qualified and experienced professionals are excluded from the labor market through opaque, automated, and fragmented recruitment processes.

At the same time, employers report persistent talent shortages, rising recruitment costs, and repeated operational mistakes caused by lost institutional knowledge.

JunkedOut addresses this disconnect by collecting, validating, and analyzing real-world recruitment data to make systemic patterns visible and actionable.

## What JunkedOut is (and is not)

**JunkedOut is:**
- A transparency and research platform
- Evidence-driven and methodology-focused
- Privacy-first and GDPR-aware
- Open-source and founder-led

**JunkedOut is not:**
- A court, arbitration body, or legal authority
- A harassment or public shaming platform
- An unmoderated complaint board
- A replacement for legal or HR advice

---

## Key components

- Structured, anonymized reporting of recruitment experiences  
- Moderation and validation workflows  
- Aggregated analytics and public indicators  
- Privacy-preserving recruitment tools (identity-shielded hiring functionality)  
- Open research access under controlled conditions

## What help is needed right now

JunkedOut is at an early, foundational stage. The project needs contributors who want to actively participate in defining, designing, implementing, and testing new mechanisms related to transparency and bias-resistant hiring processes.

Current priorities include:

- System and process design
  - defining core workflows, roles, and responsibilities
  - designing how data is collected, validated, and aggregated
  - identifying abuse vectors and designing countermeasures early

- Architecture and development
  - designing and implementing backend and API structures
  - reviewing data models, configuration boundaries, and security assumptions
  - building and testing features that extend beyond the current minimal data collection

- Methodology and evaluation
  - defining measurable notions of fairness, transparency, and accountability
  - proposing indicators, constraints, and validation rules
  - challenging assumptions to improve robustness and defensibility

- Testing and adversarial thinking
  - exploring how systems could be misused or gamed
  - stress-testing workflows with realistic scenarios
  - strengthening reliability before wider visibility or adoption

To contribute, start by opening an Issue that:
- identifies a concrete problem or gap
- proposes an approach or design direction
- highlights risks (privacy, security, abuse)
- defines what meaningful progress would look like
